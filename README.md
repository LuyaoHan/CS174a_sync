Sync Repo for the Course CS174A Intoduction to Data Base Management at University of California, Santa Barbara
Taken in Winter 2021 with Professor Shumo Chu. 

Lecture Videos were not uploaded because the lecturer were bad at explaining concepts shown on the PPTs.
The PPTs and several homeworks were good materials for future references.
